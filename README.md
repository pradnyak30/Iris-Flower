This Project have very basic application of machine learning algorithms with python programming. Here in this Iris Fower classifiction dataset, following steps are included, which helps to understand the data, to get insights of the data and to build a models and analyse the model.

**Steps for building a model :**

1.Import required Libraries and Load the data.

2.Explore the data.

3.Preprocess the data.

4.Visualization.

5.Split the data into training and testing sets.

6.Build a model.

7.Result.

It focuses on IRIS flower classification using Machine Learning and tools. Here some of algorithm are used which are some types of Machine learning algorithms of supervised and Unsupervised learning. Algorithm used for predicting and get accuracy are -
- Logistic Regression
- Dicision tree classifier
- Random Forest
- SVC
- K nearest classifier (KNN)
  
This is easy and understable for machine learning staters.
